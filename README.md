internet connection is required to run this project as it content CDN and json link
run index file in ant local server 
for VS code install the live server and right click on index.html file and open it with live server
once it is open start typing in the search box it will show all the name and color typed in the search box

this is a simple project need not to install any library to run this
For UI css grid, css flex and other libraries are available like bootstrap but i created this using core css and js
we can add validation and additional check for API response which is not done in this.
i have take care the unwanted calls for example if user type a it will look for all the matches for a but user type b than it will cancel the previous request and start looking for ab string this is how it works
